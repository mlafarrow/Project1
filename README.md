## Project 2: Climate Change
#### by Emily Farrow



### Overview
I chose the subject of Climate Change with the emphasis on the current state of Earth and onward into the future. This is an important subject because I believe it is a uniting cause that we as humans should be working on together to help slow down our ecological footprint and reverse the damage we have done. It is something that should be taking seriously because in our lifetimes, we will have to face extreme weather conditions, extreme air pollution, ocean pollution that not only affects wildlife but then plastics that we consume in our food, etc.; the list goes on. I am keeping the topic broad to all areas of climate change for the purpose of my game. 
The idea of this game is to inform the user on the subject of Climate Change while still keeping it fun to navigate through. My game starts off in the present year of 2021 where I educate the player (with an NPC) about the current state of Earth and what issues are at hand, yet giving the character a “fun” goal to reach at the end of the game. The game then leads to two different rooms that then keep pushing more into the future based on the decision you make. If you make a decision to go forward into one room, you would not be able to navigate back into the last room to show the permanence of the decision with the environment. NPCs will educate you along the way about the topic while still keeping it light enough that you enjoy the game. As for the aesthetics of the game, I would like to keep it to earth tones for obvious reasons, but I would also have to use different color palettes based on the natural disasters that happen in each room. I also wanted to use the 8-bit look if I can find an easier way to make that happen, it is a lot harder so far than I expected. If I can do the 8-bit look, I would also choose a blocky text to go with it. I would have to figure out different fonts for a different aesthetic. In this regard, I might spend too much time on the assets. Technically speaking, I might struggle with the buttons because I had a hard time with that on the last project too, but I will try my best to get that under my belt. I will have to find a balance between the time spent on the assets and the time spent on the code.
