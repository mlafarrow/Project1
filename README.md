## Project 2: Jeff Bezos VS the World
#### by Emily Farrow



### Overview
I chose the subject of Climate Change and Amazon's contribution to it. This is an important subject because I believe it is a uniting cause that we as humans should be working on together to help slow down our ecological footprint and reverse the damage we have done. It is something that should be taking seriously because in our lifetimes, we will have to face extreme weather conditions, extreme air pollution, ocean pollution that not only affects wildlife but then plastics that we consume in our food, etc.; the list goes on. I am focusing on the problems of ocean and air pollution while also touching on worker's rights for Amazon employees. 
The idea of this game is to inform the user on the subject of Climate Change while still keeping it fun to navigate through. My game starts off introducing the NPC, the magic toad, whose purpose is to guide Jeff Bezos in making changes in his company for the sake of the world and his employees. The game doesn't have a "good ending" and instead Jeff Bezos wins because that is the reality of where we are at. There is an underlying tone of satire and humor to keep the topic light just because it ends so terribly.
